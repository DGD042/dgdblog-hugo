I am a graduate student with high environmental sensitivity, intellectual curiosity, and inquiring spirit. I have the capacity to analyze and interpret environmental problems proactively, I exhibit critical and reflexive thinking, and I also have the ability to provide added value to research activities. My areas of expertise include hydraulics, hydrology, climatology, and, in general terms, research projects in the field of climate studies and data analysis.
